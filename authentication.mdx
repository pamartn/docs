## API Key Authentication

Fetchin uses API key authentication. All API requests must include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header.

### Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up for a [Fetchin account](/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Click the eye icon to reveal your API key
4. Copy the key and store it securely

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code, public repositories, or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header for every request:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/posts?profileUrlOrUrn=..." \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const headers = {
  'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key-here'
};

const response = await fetch('https://your-domain.com/api/v1/posts?profileUrlOrUrn=...', {
  headers
});
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key-here'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://your-domain.com/api/v1/posts',
    headers=headers,
    params={'profileUrlOrUrn': '...'}
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables, never hardcode it:

    ```bash
    export FETCHIN_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

    ```javascript
    const apiKey = process.env.FETCHIN_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Server-Side Only">
    Make API requests from your backend server, not from client-side JavaScript that runs in the browser.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys Regularly">
    If you suspect your key has been compromised, contact support immediately to rotate it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage">
    Check your dashboard regularly for unusual activity or unexpected usage patterns.
  </Accordion>

## Authentication Errors

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when your API key is missing or invalid:

```json
{
  "error": "Missing API key. Include X-API-Key header."
}
```

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're including the `X-API-Key` header
- Check that your API key is copied correctly
- Verify your API key hasn't been revoked

### 429 Too Many Requests

Returned when you've exceeded your quota:

```json
{
  "error": "Quota exceeded. Upgrade your plan or wait for renewal."
}
```

**Solutions:**
- Wait for your quota to renew (check renewal date in dashboard)
- Upgrade to a plan with higher limits
- Purchase additional requests

## Testing Authentication

Test your authentication setup:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/v1/profile?profileUrlOrUrn=https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here" \
  -v
```

Successful authentication will return a `200 OK` status code with the requested data.
