## How Quotas Work

Fetchin uses a quota system to track your API usage. Each API request consumes one request from your quota.

### Request Counting

- ✅ **Successful requests** - Count toward your quota
- ❌ **Failed requests** (4xx, 5xx errors) - Also count toward your quota
- 🔄 **Quota renewal** - Happens automatically on your renewal date

<Info>
  Even failed requests count toward your quota. Make sure to handle errors properly to avoid wasting requests.

## Monitoring Your Quota

### Dashboard

Your dashboard shows real-time quota information:

- **Requests Remaining** - How many requests you have left
- **Plan Limit** - Your monthly quota
- **Renewal Date** - When your quota will reset
- **Usage Chart** - Daily breakdown of your requests

### Checking Quota Programmatically

Currently, quota information is only available through the dashboard. API endpoint for quota checking coming soon!

## Quota Management

### What Happens When You Run Out?

When your quota reaches 0, API requests will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error:

```json
{
  "error": "Quota exceeded. Upgrade your plan or wait for renewal."
}
```

### Options When Quota Is Exceeded

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wait for renewal">
    Your quota automatically resets on your renewal date (shown in dashboard)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upgrade your plan">
    Contact sales for an Enterprise plan with higher limits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Purchase overage">
    Coming soon - buy additional requests without upgrading
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Future: Overage Billing

We're working on overage billing that will let you:

- Automatically purchase additional requests when quota is low
- Pay per request for usage beyond your plan
- Never get blocked by quota limits
- Set spending caps for cost control

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cache results when possible">
    Store API responses locally to avoid redundant requests for the same data.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Implement retry logic with backoff">
    Use exponential backoff for failed requests instead of immediately retrying.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor your usage">
    Check your dashboard regularly to track usage patterns and avoid surprises.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle quota errors gracefully">
    Always check for 429 errors and provide appropriate user feedback.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quota Reset Schedule

Quotas reset monthly on your signup anniversary:

- **Signed up on January 15** → Resets on the 15th of each month
- **Signed up on March 31** → Resets on the last day of each month
- Time zone: UTC

<Warning>
  Unused requests do NOT carry over to the next month. Use them or lose them!
</Warning>
